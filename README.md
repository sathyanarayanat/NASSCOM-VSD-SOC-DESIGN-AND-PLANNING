## Day-1 - Synthesis of RTL

Aim: we are going to calculate the Flop ratio after the systhesis of RTL of Picorv32a.

### Step 1 - Setting up openlane environment

### Step 2 - Run Synthesis of the RTL

### Step 3 - Calculate the flop ratio

Flop ratio = number of d-flipflops / Total number of cells = 1613/14876 = 0.10842969 .
